# whenami

Ever felt lost in time? Gotten confused by timey wimey wibbly wobbly stuff?
Misplaced your flying DeLorean? Had problems remembering *when* you are?

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, `whenami` could be just the
tool for you![^1]


## Installation

Building from source typically requires the source code, Swift 4, a computer and
tons of other things you may or may not have taken for granted.

Obtaining the source code is trivial and is left as an exercise for the reader.
[GitHub releases of whenami](https://github.com/ireblom/whenami/releases/) or
running `git clone https://github.com/ireblom/whenami` may be considered as
interesting resources by lazy readers.

Building and installing `whenami` is even more straightforward than obtaining
the source code; build and install from source by running:

```
make install
```


## Usage

To find out when you are, just run `whenami` without any command line arguments.

Should that question not be complicated enough for you, consider exploring any
of the arguments supported by `whenami` as listed below:

```
usage: whenami [-h] [-v]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --version  show version number and exit
```
